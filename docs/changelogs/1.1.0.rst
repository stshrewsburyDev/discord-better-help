    * Removed redundant decimals
    * Pluralised "seconds" when required
    * Capitalised cooldown type and put into brackets

        * After: ``1 second (Channel)`` ``30 seconds (User)`` ``2.5 seconds (Global)``


Additions:

* Fixed bug where removed variable from :py:class:`Navigation()` would cause an ``AttributeError`` if called (`GitHub issue link <https://github.com/stshrewsburyDev/discord-better-help/issues/2>`_)
* Fixed bug where using custom ending notes with ``ending_note`` wouldn't properly format the message with the prefix and command. (Refer to :py:class:`Help()`)
